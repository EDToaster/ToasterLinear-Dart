# Toaster Linear Algebra Library

Implements some of the most useful linear algebra functions, provides a way to transform coordinates in n-space down to m-space. 


# Road map
* Integrate generics support for spaces and subspaces
* Implement support for custom scalar multiplication, zero vector, and addition.
* Implement simple definition of subspace (generics support)
